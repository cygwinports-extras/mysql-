ldesc: "MySQL++ is a C++ wrapper for MySQLâ€™s C API. It is built around 
the same principles as the Standard C++ Library, to make dealing with 
the database as easy as dealing with STL containers. In addition, 
MySQL++ provides facilities that let you avoid the most repetitive sorts 
of SQL within your own code, providing native C++ interfaces for these 
common tasks."
